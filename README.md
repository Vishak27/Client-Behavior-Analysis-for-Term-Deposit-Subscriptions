Client Behavior Analysis for Term Deposit Subscriptions
Overview
This project analyzes client behavior to predict term deposit subscriptions using machine learning models. The analysis uses the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to identify key factors that influence a client's decision to subscribe to a term deposit, providing actionable insights for more effective marketing strategies.
